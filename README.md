- 👋 Hi, I’m @pmellalieu Peter Mellalieu.
- 👀 I’m interested in streamlining the task of defining requirements for ambitious user experience and the consequent coding required to realise that design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to coordinate several development teams with various levels of capability, from student teams to outstanding professionals ... scattered world-wide.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on robust, cost-effective ways to do my job... in the context of a small-scale enterprise with global ambitions.
